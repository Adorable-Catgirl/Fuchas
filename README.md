# Shindows OS
Shindows is an operating system made for the OpenComputers mod.
  
It is based on a driver architecture to fullfil all components, like sound drivers for allowing programs
to easily get adapter to Computronics's Sound Card or the default PC Speaker.
Shindows is capable of all that by using a different kernel from most graphical OSs made before.
  
It also have a scheduler and a task/process management system. Due to Lua nature, it is based on
cooperative multitasking.
